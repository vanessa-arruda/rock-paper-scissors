# rock-paper-scissors
## Version 1.0 - Game in Javascript

The user is prompted to type "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" in the console
and plays against the computer, that will randomly choose an option.

It's a 5 matches and who has the biggest score in the end, wins.

as part of The Odin Project (2023).
